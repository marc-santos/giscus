## ⚙️ How it works

When giscus loads, the GitHub Discussions search API is used to find the discussion associated with the page based on a chosen mapping (URL, `pathname`, `<title>`, and others).

If no matching discussion is found, a discussion can be created the first time someone comments or reacts.

To comment, visitors authorize the giscus app using GitHub OAuth, or comment directly on GitHub.
